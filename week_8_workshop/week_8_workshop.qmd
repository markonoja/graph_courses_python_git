### Load Packages

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
```

### Import Data

```{python}
# Import the CSV file
india_tb = pd.read_csv("../data/india_tuberculosis.csv")
india_tb
```


```{python}
#convert all column 
india_tb.columns = india_tb.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')
india_tb
```
### Calculate Total Cost
Each patient record notes the location and cost of up to three visits. Add together these costs (`first_visit_cost`, `second_visit_cost`, and `third_visit_cost`) to create a `total_cost` variable.

```{python}
# Calculate total cost
india_tb["total_cost"] = india_tb["first_visit_cost"].fillna(0) + india_tb["second_visit_cost"].fillna(0) + india_tb["third_visit_cost"].fillna(0)

india_tb
```
## Investigating Healthcare Costs by Education Level

### Reorder Education Levels

```{python}
# Count unique values of education levels
india_tb["education"].value_counts()
```

## Investigating Healthcare Costs by Education Level

### Reorder Education Levels

```{python}
# use the `replace()` method to convert the "Graduate & Above" values to "Graduate".
india_tb["education"] = india_tb["education"].replace("Graduate & Above","Graduate")
india_tb["education"]
```
## To reorder the education levels: 
By converting the `education` variable into a categorical variable with the levels defined in a specific order:

```{python}
education_levels = [
    "No Education",
    "Primary",
    "Middle",
    "Secondary",
    "Higher Secondary",
    "Graduate",
    "Missing",
]

india_tb["education"] = pd.Categorical(
    india_tb["education"], categories=education_levels, ordered=True
)
```


```{python}
india_tb["education"].value_counts()
```

### Table of Costs by Education Level

Use pandas methods to group by education level and create a summary table with two variables:

- The number of patients in each education level
- The mean total cost for each education level

Store the resulting DataFrame as an object called `edu_cost_table`

```{python}
# Create summary table
edu_cost_table = india_tb.groupby("education").agg(num_patients=("id","size"),
mean_total_cost=("total_cost", "mean")).reset_index()

edu_cost_table
```

Reorder the rows of the summary table to go from highest to lowest mean cost. You can use the `sort_values()` method to do this.


```{python}
# Reorder summary table
edu_cost_table = edu_cost_table.sort_values(by='mean_total_cost', ascending=False)

# Display the sorted table
print(edu_cost_table)
```

Which education level has the highest mean total cost of treatment?

Graduate

### Visualize Costs by Education Level

Using `plotly.express` and the costs summary table you created earlier, create a bar plot of mean costs by education level. It should be sorted from lowest education level to highest education level.


```{python}

edu_cost_table = edu_cost_table.sort_values(by="education")

#create the bar chart
fig = px.bar(
    edu_cost_table,
    x="education",
    y="mean_total_cost",
    title="Mean Total Cost by Education Level",
    labels= {"education" : "Education Level", "mean_total_cost" : "Mean Total Cost"},
    text="mean_total_cost"
)

# Format the text on bars
fig.update_traces(texttemplate="%{text:.2f}", textposition="outside")

fig.show()

```

 
 
## Update layout for better readability


```{python}
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title="Education Level",
    yaxis_title="Mean Total Cost",
    showlegend=False
)

# Show the plot
fig.show()  # Corrected method call
```
